# TubNet Tweaks
[Tubble Post](https://forums.tubnet.gg/threads/6410) | 
A resource pack (the first!) for [TubNet](https://forums.tubnet.gg/) that improves the TubNet user interface, and the look of the games Tubnet offers overall.

## Installing
This pack only works on Minecraft: Java Edition. Bedrock Edition downloads may come soon.
### Using the Server Pack Unlocker (SPU) mod
In vanilla Minecraft, you cannot move the server resource pack in the menu - it's always at the top. This mod allows you to move the server resource pack. The only downside of this mod is that you have to load the resource pack **every single time** you join TubNet.

You should download the resource pack from the [modrinth page](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/tubnet-tweaks) first before starting this process. 

This mod runs on [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
You can download the Server Pack Unlocker mod [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/server-pack-unlocker).

### Using directly via Tubion
Tubion is a mod that adds QOL (Quality-Of-Life) features to the TubNet server. It also bundles TubNet Tweaks with it - and loads the resource pack automatically!

This mod requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).
You can download Tubion [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/tubion) - Curseforge support is coming soon!
